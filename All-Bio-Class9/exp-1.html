       To study the life cycle of mosquito.

 		<h3>Theory :</h3>
        <h3>Mosquitoes :</h3>
 		<p>
 		 <ol>
          <li>Insect family, Phylum-Arthropoda. There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes found throughout the world</li>
          <li><b>Vectors:</b>Mosquitoes are vectors as they are carrier of pathogens that causes diseases.</li>
          <li><b>Feeding Habit of Adult Mosquitoes:</b>Both male and female mosquitoes feed on nectars, but the female mosquitoes feed on blood of many mammals as they need proteins and iron to develop eggs.</li>
          <li>Some species feed at day time and some during dawn/dusk</li>
          <li><b>Detection of host:</b>Female mosquitoes detect their host by detecting carbon dioxide from a distance</li>
          <li><b>Common diseases caused by mosquitoes :</b>Yellow fever, Malaria, Dengue, Chickengunea</li>
          <li><b>Life span of adult Mosquito:</b>Most male mosquitoes live only for a week and females live for about a month</li>
          <li><b>Importance of water:</b>All mosquitoes need water to complete their life cycle. All female mosquitoes lay their eggs on water.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Metamorphism :</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>The developmental stages of an adult mosquito, from its egg to an adult, is called metamorphosis.</li> 
           <li>The length of the life cycle of mosquito is 30 days<br><img src="images/s1.jpg"></li>

 		<h3>Procedures</h3>
 		<p>
 			<ul>
                 <li>Observe the given specimen carefully. Study the different stages of the life cycle of mosquito and note down the feature of each stage.</li>
                 <li>Draw diagram of the life cycle of mosquito.</li>

          <h3>Mosquito Egg Raft [I stage]</h3>
          <b>1.</b>The eggs are small, nearly 200-300 eggs sticking each other form a raft that floats on water and is about 1/4 inch long and <br>1/8 inch wide. This stage lasts for 24-48 hrs<br>
          <br><img src="images/s2.jpg"><br><br>
          <b>2.</b>
          <h3>Larva [II stage]</h3><br>
          The larva emerges out from the egg within 48 hours.Larvae are commonly called ‘wrigglers’. They have a tube like body called siphon attached on their abdomen. They come to the surface of water at frequent intervals to breathe oxygen with the help of siphon. The larvae then wriggle down in water. They eat algae and small organisms in water.Larva sheds its skin four times (molting) the stages between molts is called instars.At the last instar, larva reaches a length of almost 1/2 inch and coils to form a pupa. This stage last for 7-14 days.

          <h3>Pupa [III stage]</h3>
          The pupa formed from larva, floats in water. It takes oxygen through its two breathing tubes called “trumpets’.When the water is disturbed the pupa tumbles down and floats back on surface of water, so it is called “Tumblers”.This is hibernating stage when pupa does not eat and only rest/sleep. This stage last for 1-4 days.

          <h3>Adult Mosquito [IV stage]</h3>
          The adult mosquito splits the pupa case and comes out on the surface of the water. It rests for sometime, until its body is dry and hard. It flies off in search of food.Male mosquito feeds on sugars, nectar from flowers.Female mosquito feeds on blood.

        <h3>Prevention and control:</h3>
        <p>
           <ul>
               <li>Destroy the breeding grounds</li>
               <li>Kill the mosquitoes</li>
