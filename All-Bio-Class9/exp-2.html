 		<h3>Aim :</h3>
 	  <p>
       To study the external features of root, stem, leaf and flower of monocot and dicot plants
     </p>

 		<h3>Theory :</h3>
        <p>
 		 <ul>
           <li><b>Angiosperms:</b>All flower bearing plants are called angiosperms. It has been divided into two categories, i.e. Monocotyledon and Dicotyledon.</li>
           <li><b>Cotyledon:</b>Seed leaves are called cotyledons.<br><img src="images/s7.jpg"></li>
           <li><img src="images/s9.jpg"></li>
           <li><b>Germination:</b>Growth of radicle and plumule from the seed is called germination. The seed swells and the radicle breaks out through the seed coat at the Micropyle.</li>
           <li><b>Micropyle:</b>It is the weak spot in the seed coat where the radicle escapes into the growing medium.</li>
           <li><b>Hypocotyl:</b>The connection between the radicle and the cotyledon, which develops into hook and pushes the growing seed towards the surface.</li>
           <li><b>Epicotyl:</b>It is the mature shoot which begins to grow.<br><img src="images/s10.jpg"></li>
       </ul>

 		<h3>Matierials Required :</h3>
 		<p>
 			
            <ul>
                <li>Sample of monocot and dicot plants.</li>
                <li> 10-20 days prior soaked seeds which have shown the germination</li>
                <li>seeds of maize</li>
                <li>seeds of wheat</li>
                <li>seeds of gram</li>
                <li>seeds of peas</li>
                <li>Slides of T.S. of Monocot stem and Dicot stem</li>

 	<div class="Procedures">
 		<h3>Procedures</h3>
 		<p>
 			<ul>
                 <li>Take two seeds of maize and peas each and soak them in water. Allow them to become tender. Next day try to split the seed. Observe whether the seeds break into two equal halves.</li>
                 <li>Take the germinated seeds, bearing root leaves, stems, flowers and have turned into plants.</li>
                 <li>Observe the root system in both maize and peas, type of venation in leaves. Record your observations.</li>
                 <li>Now look at the stem of both the plants, woody, fleshy, branched, unbranched etc.</li>
                 <li>Observe the flowers carefully for both maize and pea plant and carefully see the number of sepals, petals, type of pollens in each flower.</li>
                 <li>Observe the transverse section of slide showing Monocot and Dicot stem with arrangement of vascular bundles.</li>
                 <li>Record your observation in the table and draw diagrams of all the parts studied by you.</li>      
            </ul>

        <h3>Precaution</h3>
        <p>
           <ul>
               <li>Seeds should be soaked for a day or two. (in winters soak the seeds in lukewarm water)</li>
               <li>During germination of seed, put the seeds in wet cotton initially</li>
               <li>The colour of sepals and petals in most of the monocots may be same (tepals), do not get confused over this</li>
